# Note Taker

![MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

This application can be used to write and store notes all in one place. The front end for the application was already created, and it was my task to write the back end, connect the front and back ends, and deploy the application to Heroku. I accomplished this by using Express.js for the back end and storing the notes in a JSON file.
